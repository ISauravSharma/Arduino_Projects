Arduino Based Projects
This repository contains my Arduino projects.
The following projects are done:
1) Voltage_Controlled_Lights : Depending upon different voltage range different LED's glow. Practical similar uses are various meters                                    which uses LED signaling for different analog or digital data.
2) Binary_Counter : Using LED's binary counter from 0 to 15 is implemented.
3) Pushbutton_Toggle_Switch : Pushbutton is used as Toggle Switch using this program and state of LED is displayed on LCD.
4) Obstacle_distance : Distance of an obstacle from ultrasonic sensor can be measured and displayed on LED.
